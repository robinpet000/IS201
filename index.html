                    <h1>Education</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Graduated from Hamilton Southeastern High School with a Honors Degree</li>
                        <li>Currently Studying at Brigham Young University working on a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h1>Experience</h1>
                    <p>I have worked three different jobs. The most important and impactful to my life was working for CodeNinjas. There I worked as a Sensei (teacher). This allowed me to work with the kids we taught and teach them languages like JavaScript, Luau, and C#. This was done by helping kids progress through levels in which they coded games using one of the languages. This helped me to better understand code and I gained skills as a leader.</p>
                    <h1>Skills</h1>
                    <h3>Coding</h3>
                    <p>I learned how to better code and have studied this throughout high school and my year at college. I have learned lots of parts of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, and more. I still plan to keep learning and better my skills in these languages and learn more. </p>
                    <h3>Leadership</h3>
                    <p>I have gained many leadership skills while being on of the oldest employees in past jobs. I was often asked for help when trying to figure out how to help others.</p>
                    <h3>Hard Work</h3>
                    <p>I learned how to work hard by working 2 jobs at the same time and minor projects during my senior year of High School.</p>
                    <h3>Communication</h3>
                    <p>At CodeNinjas I had to communicate with many different kids with different learning styles. Then after it was my job to debrief the parents on what their kid had learned. This taught me tactics to be a better communicator. </p>
